# microarmature_surface_feature_dataset

This repository is an open-source dataset of micro armature solder surface features. The dataset is collected in the commercial company, containing 4 major types of surface defects and 3 common surface features, with localization annotations.

Our paper is edtitled “A Logic-Guided Intelligent Multi-Defect Detection System for Microarmatures”. 

This dataset is strictly forbidden to be used for commercial purposes and should only be used for academic research.
